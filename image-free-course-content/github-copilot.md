"A vibrant purple and teal graphic announcing a 'GitHub Copilot tutorial' for beginners.  The main focus is a stylized cartoon cat, dark blue with orange highlights, wearing a dark suit,  appearing to use a technological device.  A smaller, robot-like character is in the upper left.  The text 'GitHub for Beginners' appears in a smaller font above the larger, bold title 'GitHub Copilot tutorial'. The GitHub logo is present to the left of the smaller text.  The background includes several abstract, iridescent shapes in shades of purple, teal, and green. The overall style is playful and modern."]](https://youtu.be/n0NlxUyA7FI)
