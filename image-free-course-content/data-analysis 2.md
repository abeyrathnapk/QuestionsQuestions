Once you've prepared the data, your next task is to analyze it to get insights that are not immediately obvious.

In this module, you'll learn:

- **Statistical analysis**: Calculate correlations, regressions, forecasts, and outliers using **spreadsheets**
- **Data summarization**: Aggregate and pivot data using **Python** and **databases**.
- **Geo-data Collection &amp; Processing**: Gather and process geospatial data using tools like Python (GeoPandas) and QGIS.
- **Geo-visualization**: Create and visualize geospatial data on maps using Excel, QGIS, and Python libraries such as Folium.
- **Network &amp; Proximity Analysis**: Analyze geospatial relationships and perform network analysis to understand data distribution and clustering.
- **Storytelling &amp; Decision Making**: Develop narratives and make informed decisions based on geospatial data insights.

[[Image description: Here's alt text describing the image:

A dark-blue slide shows a chart comparing methods for modeling data.  The title at the top reads "Model the data" in white text. Below, three orange rectangular boxes are presented.  The first, leftmost box, is labeled "Excel," followed by three smaller rectangular buttons underneath reading "Correlation," "Regression," and "Outlier detection." The middle box is titled "Python" and contains three buttons below labeled "Classification," "Forecasting," and "Clustering." The third box, on the right, simply says "Others."  A small, partially visible letter "G" is located in the bottom-left corner. In the bottom right corner, a video inset shows a man with dark hair and glasses, wearing a long-sleeved dark shirt,  sitting in front of a wooden ship's wheel. The overall color scheme is dark blue, orange, and white.]](https://youtu.be/CRSljunxjnk)
