## Actor Network Visualization

Find the shortest path between Govinda &amp; Angelina Jolie using IMDb data using Python: [networkx](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/) or [scikit-network](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-network).

[[Image description: Here's alt text describing the image:

A split image shows Bollywood actor Govinda on the left, and a digitally altered image of Govinda as a Na'vi from the movie Avatar on the right.  Govinda is shown from the chest up, wearing a dark jacket over an orange shirt. He has dark hair and is looking directly at the viewer with a serious expression. The background is a blurry light brown wood-paneled wall. The right side displays a close-up of Govinda's face superimposed onto a Na'vi body, complete with blue skin, pointed ears, and long dark braids with orange and yellow beads.  At the top, text reads "GOVINDA DECLINES "AVATAR" FILM BY JAMES CAMERON".  Below that, smaller text states "Claims he suggested the title". In the bottom right corner, a small "INDIA" logo is visible with a website address partially visible underneath. The overall color scheme is muted browns and oranges on the left contrasting with the vibrant blue of the altered Na'vi image on the right.]](https://youtu.be/lcwMsPxPIjc)
