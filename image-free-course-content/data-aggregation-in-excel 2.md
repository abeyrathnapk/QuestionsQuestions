## Data Aggregation in Excel

[[Image description: A screenshot shows a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with data on COVID-19 cases in Brazil, alongside a "New Formatting Rule" dialog box.  The spreadsheet, predominantly blue and white, displays columns for ISO code, location (Brazil), date, week, month, year, and various case counts (total cases, new cases, cases per million, etc.). The data is numerically based and formatted with light and dark blue shading highlighting different values.  The "New Formatting Rule" dialog box allows the user to select how to format cells based on their values, with a color scale preview using shades of green and yellow.  The dialog box also provides options for theme and standard colors.  At the bottom of the screen, a partially visible person, appearing to be a man with dark hair and glasses, is also visible.  The tab at the bottom indicates a "Step 3" progress is being shown, suggesting this is a tutorial or instructional capture.  The search bar at the top of the Excel sheet shows "new_cases".]](https://youtu.be/NkpT0dDU8Y4)

You'll learn data aggregation and visualization techniques in Excel, covering:

- **Data Cleanup**: Remove empty columns and rows with missing values.
- **Creating Excel Tables**: Convert raw data into tables for easier manipulation and formula application.
- **Date Manipulation**: Extract week, month, and year from date columns using Excel functions (WEEKNUM, TEXT).
- **Color Scales**: Apply color scales to visualize clusters and trends in data over time.
- **Pivot Tables**: Create pivot tables to aggregate data by location and date, summarizing values weekly and monthly.
- **Sparklines**: Use sparklines to visualize trends within pivot tables, making data patterns more apparent.
- **Data Bars**: Implement data bars for graphical illustrations of numerical columns, showing trends and waves.
