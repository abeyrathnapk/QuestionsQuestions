## Narratives with Comics

[[Image description: Here's alt text describing the image:

A screenshot shows a webpage featuring a simple black-and-white cartoon of a person standing with arms crossed. The person is depicted in a minimalist style.  The webpage is primarily white with light blue accents on buttons and links. Text on the page invites users to join the "#ComicgenFriday" community and mentions "Data Comicgen Awards."  There are buttons to share on Twitter and suggest improvements.  A small video window in the bottom right corner shows a man with a beard looking at the camera. The overall impression is of a website related to data visualization and storytelling using cartoon illustrations.]](https://youtu.be/HZDqCQBpHGI)
