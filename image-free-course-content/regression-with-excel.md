## Regression with Excel

[[Image description: Here's alt text describing the image:

A screenshot shows a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet displaying regression analysis results. The top shows the Excel menu bar with the filename "Book1" visible.  The spreadsheet shows statistical data, including columns labeled "ANOVA," "Regression," "Residual," "Total," "Coefficient," "Standard Error," "t Stat," "P-value," and confidence intervals (upper and lower 95%).  Numerical data fills the cells, with values such as -235.955, 7.245436, and 2.71314 prominently displayed. The data appears to be related to a regression analysis of "new_cases_per_thousand" as indicated in a search box near the top of the spreadsheet.  In the lower-right corner, a small video window shows a personâ€™s face, likely the presenter in a video tutorial.  The overall color scheme is the standard Excel interface, featuring primarily white and light gray backgrounds with blue and green accents in the menus and spreadsheet headers. The video window displays a darker background. The spreadsheet is largely empty except for the analytical data in the upper left quadrant.]](https://youtu.be/AERQBMIHwXA)

You'll learn to perform regression analysis using Excel, covering:

- **Data Preparation**: Understanding the cleaned dataset and necessary columns for analysis.
- **Enabling the Tool**: How to enable the Data Analysis Tool Pack in Excel.
- **Types of Regression**: Differences between simple and multiple linear regression.
- **Setting Up Regression**: Steps to input dependent (new deaths) and independent variables (new cases, new tests, new vaccinations, stringency index) for the analysis.
- **Interpreting Output**: Reading the regression output, focusing on adjusted R-squared, significance value (F-test), and P-values.
- **Coefficient Interpretation**: Understanding the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable, including scaling factors (per 1000 units).
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model based on significance values and understanding the implications of unexpected results (e.g., stringency index).
- **Further Analysis**: Recognizing the need for additional analysis when encountering unexpected or inconclusive results.
