## Data Preparation in the Editor

[[Image description: Here's alt text describing the image:

A screenshot shows a Visual Studio Code window displaying a JSON file named "city-product-sales.json." The file contains structured data listing cities, products sold, and sales figures.  The data is organized into multiple objects, each with "city," "product," and "sales" fields. Examples include "Rio de Janiero" selling "Bananas" with 82 sales, "Mannila" selling "Apples" with 30 sales, and "Cairo" selling "Bananas" with 29 sales. The background is dark, with the code displayed in light-colored text. The bottom of the screen shows the line and column numbers of the cursor position (Line 1, Column 1), and various status indicators including encoding (UTF-8), line endings (LF), and JSON formatting tools.  A search bar is visible at the bottom left.  The overall color scheme is dark mode with a primarily dark gray or black background and light text.]](https://youtu.be/99lYu43L9uM)

You'll learn how to use a text editor [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to process and clean data, covering:

- **Format** JSON files
- **Find all** and multiple cursors to extract specific fields
- **Sort** lines
- **Delete duplicate** lines
- **Replace** text with multiple cursors
