# Data visualization

[[Image description: Here's alt text describing the image:

A dark-blue slide displays a presentation about "Design the output," categorizing data visualization tools. Two orange rectangular boxes, labeled "General" and "Specialized," each list several software options.  The "General" box lists Excel, Google Data Studio, Power BI, and Tableau.  The "Specialized" box lists Excel (VBA), Flourish Studio, Kumu, and QGIS.  In the lower right corner, a small video shows a light-skinned man with graying hair, wearing a blue shirt, gesturing with both hands. A small letter "G" is visible in the bottom left corner of the slide.]](https://youtu.be/XkxRDql00UU)
