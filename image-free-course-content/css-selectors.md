## CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements on a web page. They are fundamental to web development and data scraping, allowing you to precisely target elements for styling or extraction.

For data scientists, understanding CSS selectors is crucial when:

- Web scraping with tools like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy
- Selecting elements for browser automation with Selenium
- Styling data visualizations and web applications
- Debugging website issues using browser DevTools

A black and white close-up shot of a young man with dark hair styled neatly. He has a questioning expression on his face.  Behind him, a vibrant red banner-like shape partially obscures him. The banner features white text that reads: "Do You Know All These Selectors?" The overall style suggests a screen capture from a video or online tutorial, possibly related to web development or programming, given the question about "selectors."]](https://youtu.be/l1mER1bV0N0)

The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) provides detailed documentation on the three main types of selectors:

- [Attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Attribute_selectors): Target elements based on their attributes or attribute values (`[type="text"]`)
- [Combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Combinators): Use relationships between elements (`div &gt; p`, `div + p`, `div ~ p`)
