## Geospatial Analysis with Excel

[[Image description: Here's alt text describing the image:

A 3D map of Manhattan, New York City, displays data as 3D bars overlaid on a street map.  The bars are primarily dark green and gold, varying in height to represent an unknown data point (likely population density or a similar metric).  The darker green bars are concentrated in central Manhattan, while gold bars are more dispersed throughout, particularly on the edges.  The underlying map is a light pastel color scheme with roads, water (depicted in blue), and other geographical features visible. The overall color palette is muted, with the dark green and gold bars providing a strong visual contrast.  There is very small, unreadable text present on the map itself.]](https://youtu.be/49LjxNvxyVs)

You'll learn how to create a data-driven story about coffee shop coverage in Manhattan, covering:

- **Data Collection**: Collect and scrape data for coffee shop locations and census population from various sources.
- **Data Processing**: Use Python libraries like geopandas for merging population data with geographic maps.
- **Map Creation**: Generate coverage maps using tools like QGIS and Excel to visualize coffee shop distribution and population impact.
- **Visualization**: Create physical, Power BI, and video visualizations to present the data effectively.
- **Storytelling**: Craft a narrative around coffee shop competition, including strategic insights and potential market changes.
