## Outlier Detection with Excel

[[Image description: Here's alt text describing the image:

A screenshot shows a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet on a Windows computer.  The spreadsheet is predominantly white with gray grid lines.  Column A contains a list of numbers ranging from approximately 800 to 2200.  The formula bar at the top displays `=QUARTILE.EXC(A2:A844,3)`.  Below that, a smaller, less prominent formula hint displays `QUARTILE.EXC(array, quart)`. The Excel ribbon at the top is green and shows various options including "Home", "Insert", "Page Layout", and other standard Excel functions. The upper right corner of the screen shows the user's name, "Diwon Daniel".  In the bottom right corner, a small video window shows a person's torso and head. The person has dark hair and glasses and appears to be giving a presentation or tutorial. The overall color scheme is muted, with the greens of the ribbon contrasting against the whites and grays of the spreadsheet.]](https://youtu.be/sUTJb0F9eBw)

You'll learn how to identify and handle outliers in data using Excel, covering:

- **Understanding Outliers**: Definition of outliers and their impact on statistical analysis.
- **Calculating Quartiles**: Using Excel formulas to calculate Q1 (first quartile) and Q3 (third quartile).
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Finding the IQR by subtracting Q1 from Q3.
- **Determining Bounds**: Calculating lower and upper bounds using 1.5 times the IQR.
- **Identifying Outliers**: Using Excel functions to determine if data points fall outside the calculated bounds.
- **Visualizing Data**: Creating box plots to visualize outliers and data distribution.
- **Handling Outliers**: Deciding whether to exclude or keep outliers based on their impact on analysis.
