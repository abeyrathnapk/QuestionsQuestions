# Data Preparation

Data preparation is crucial because raw data is rarely perfect.

It often contains errors, inconsistencies, or missing values. For example, marks data may have 'NA' or 'absent' for non-attendees, which you need to handle.

This section teaches you how to clean up data, convert it to different formats, aggregate it if required, and get a feel for the data before you analyze.

[[Image description: A screenshot shows a table of numerical data, likely from a spreadsheet program.  The table is light beige with darker beige and pale green highlighting in some rows.  The top row shows the years 1957 to 2013, labeled across columns B through N. Row 4 is labeled "Row Labels" and lists various place names, such as "AFZALPUR," "ALAND," and "ANEKAL," down to "BAILHONGAL" in row 24.  The columns contain numerical data, mostly single-digit numbers. Above the table, the text "At this point, we start checking what's gone wrong" is visible.  In the bottom right corner, a portion of a manâ€™s face and shoulders are visible, along with what appears to be a portion of a wheel. The man appears to be of South Asian descent. The overall color palette is muted and dominated by beige and off-white tones with accents of pale green.]](https://youtu.be/dF3zchJJKqk)
