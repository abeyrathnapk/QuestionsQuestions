A screenshot shows a webpage interface for choosing a chart type.  The main section displays a grid of thumbnail previews of various chart types, each with a small title indicating the chart's name (e.g., "Scatter Plot," "Convex Hull," "Box Plot," "Cluster Dendrogram," etc.).  The charts are rendered with pastel color palettes, primarily using shades of green, pink, blue, and grey.  Each chart's thumbnail also includes a brief description beneath, such as “Dispersion” or “Hierarchy weighted”.  A selection is highlighted on the right by a teal checkmark next to "Scatter Plot."  To the left of the grid is a larger description of a "Scatter Plot," which includes a short definition of what a scatter plot is within data visualization.  The overall page is clean and uses a light grey background. The title of the page is "Choose a Chart".]](https://youtu.be/2TtYlty-M5g)
