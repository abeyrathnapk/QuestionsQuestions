The deadlines mentioned in the Grading Document provided and the TDS website
([s-anand.net](http://s-anand.net)) are different. Project-1’s deadline was 15
Feb, it was then postponed to the 16th of Feb. Can this be reflected here?  
Not affecting me particularly, however, it’s good to be consistent across
channels of communication to the students…

[![A table outlining assessment details for a Data Science Diploma course. The
top shows the course title "6. Tools in Data Science (Diploma in DS),"
followed by instructions stating there are no in-center quizzes, the end-term
exam date (April 13th, 2025, in person), and eligibility requirements (average
of two out of five weekly assessments >= 40/100 to attend the final exam, and
attending the final exam to receive a course grade). The main body is a table
with columns for Assessment, Open Date, Submission Date, and Peer Review Date.
Assessment rows include a Remote Online Exam (ROE1), and two take-home
projects (P1 and P2), each with specific date ranges and instructions (open
internet, objective assessments, etc.). At the bottom, the table defines GAA
(score in best four of seven weekly assignments), F (final end-term exam), and
provides two formulas for calculating the final course score T, one with
weights of 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3 and the other with weights 0.15, 0.2, 0.2,
0.2, 0.25. All dates are given in YYYY-MM-DD format. The colors are primarily
black text on a white background with blue headers and separating
lines.](https://europe1.discourse-

Kind regards
