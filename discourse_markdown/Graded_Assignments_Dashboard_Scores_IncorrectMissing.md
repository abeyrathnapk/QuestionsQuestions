[@24ds3000061](/u/24ds3000061) [@22f2001532](/u/22f2001532)

Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the
scores have been pushed.

GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual
(i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be
made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.

Kind regards

**22f2001532** on 2025-02-12T05:32:48.000Z:

Thanks Carlton. Now the results are visible in the dashboard.
