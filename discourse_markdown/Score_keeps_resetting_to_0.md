Despite saving multiple times, my score keeps resetting to zero. Should I
refill the answers for all the questions before saving again? Could this issue
also be caused by accessing the assignment from multiple devices?

Hi Shalini,

We are aware of the issue and [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) is working on a solution.
The temporary fix is to just reenter all the answers before hitting the Save
button. Thanks for the reminder, please bear with the inconvenience while its
being fixed.

**The last submission is always saved. So please make sure that your last
submission contains all the answers for all the questions.**

Kind regards

Hello,  
I am also facing the same issue. In my last submission the score was 7.25.
Right now it is showing 0. The problem is i had few questions remaining to
solve and i dont know which ones now. All of them r showing empty in the
solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to
solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing
submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to
the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?
