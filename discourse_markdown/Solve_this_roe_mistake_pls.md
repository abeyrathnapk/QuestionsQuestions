[![Alt text: A screenshot shows a dark-themed online quiz titled "TDS 2025 Jan
ROE" with instructions displayed. The instructions, in white text on a dark
gray background, detail how to take the quiz, emphasizing that students can
check answers multiple times, use any resources they want (including hacking
the code), and save their progress regularly. A red banner at the top shows
the quiz has ended at 1:45 pm IST on March 2nd, 2025. A teal-colored box at
the bottom offers help via Discourse and Google Meet. Below this, the user is
identified as logged in with their university email address. The score is
shown as 8. The overall color scheme is dark, with teal accents. There are
also buttons labeled "Save" and "Check all".](https://europe1.discourse-

Did you submit before 1:47? If yes, then your highest score will be taken.  
If not then, you will be marked absent.
