Connect to the GitHub API- it lets you fetch user data automatically(go to
github developer settings ->personal acceess tokens->tokens(classic)  
Search for Users with criteria mentioned in your question  
We organize the list from newest to oldest, making it easy to spot the
freshest account.

Sir I am having trouble in q8 also whenever I am pushing commit in git hub it
was showing in GitHub repository but it is not working in git hub actions.  

[![Here's alt text describing the image: A screenshot shows a laptop
displaying a GitHub Actions page. The main content is a list of three workflow
runs, each labeled "Daily Commit" with a red 'x' indicating a failed status.
The first run, titled "second time," shows details like the commit message,
branch ("main"), time since run (33 minutes ago), and duration (10s). The
other two "Daily Commit" runs also show similar details, with run times of 4
hours ago (one with 10s duration, the other with 11s). The left sidebar shows
options such as "Code," "Issues," "Pull requests," "Actions" (highlighted),
"Projects," etc. and a list of Actions-related options including "All
workflows", "Daily Commit", and various management settings. The overall color
scheme is dark, with a predominantly dark gray/black background and lighter
gray text. The bottom of the screen shows a portion of the laptop's keyboard
and the ASUS Zenbook logo. The top of the screen shows the GitHub
URL.](https://europe1.discourse-

[![Here's alt text describing the image: A close-up shot of a laptop screen
displaying a GitHub repository page. The main focus is the repository's file
list on the left, showing files like "README.md" and ".github/workflows,"
along with commit messages indicating recent activity such as "third time" and
"changes done." The repository is named "my-repo," owned by "Sakshi6749." The
right side shows the repository's "About" section which currently has no
description. The screen also shows various GitHub actions in dark mode, along
with the numbers of stars, watchers, and forks (0 stars, 1 watching, 0 forks).
The laptop's keyboard and ASUS Zenbook branding are partially visible at the
bottom. The overall color scheme is dark, with a predominantly dark gray/black
background and purple accents. The top right corner shows browser tabs, and
the lower left displays a weather widget showing 14°C and
"Haze."](https://europe1.discourse-
