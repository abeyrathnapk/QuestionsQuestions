Please post any questions related to [Graded Assignment 1 - Development
Tools](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1).

## Important Instruction

Please use markdown code formatting (fenced code blocks) when sharing code in Discourse posts. This makes the code much easier to read and differentiate from non-code text. It also makes it easier for people to copy code snippets and run it themselves. Visit this link for more details: [Extended Syntax | Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks).

A friendly suggestion: kindly go through [Discourse Docs](/c/docs-
discourse/45)! ![Here's alt text describing the image: "A simple, round yellow

[![Here's alt text describing the image: "A dark-themed screenshot shows a programming exercise. The top shows the number '16' in a blue square followed by the text 'Move and rename files (0.5 marks)'. Below, instructions are given: Download 'q-move-rename-files.zip', extract it, use 'mv' to move files into an empty folder, then rename each file, incrementing digits (e.g., 'a19b.txt' becomes 'a20b.txt'). Finally, a question asks the user what the output of a bash command ('grep .* | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum') would be when run on the resulting folder. The text uses a monospaced font, and code snippets are highlighted in different colors (blue, pink)."](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/8/f8af7c6e2fe001c8bf000605b52c903e1b0e6fe1.png)image1296×158 7.29 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/8/f8af7c6e2fe001c8bf000605b52c903e1b0e6fe1.png "image")

  
For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with
the next "  
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as  
2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt  
eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt  
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. [@carlton](/u/carlton)
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or
209 → 210 is not working

**Jivraj** on 2025-01-05T05:50:28.537Z:

Hi anant,

Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.

In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

**21f2000370** on 2025-01-05T07:56:17.410Z:

Hello Sir, When I am following that logic to rename files, assessment check is
giving error “Incorrect. Try again.”

**carlton** on 2025-01-08T03:45:23.020Z:

[@21f2000370](/u/21f2000370) Since you have managed to get all the answers
correct, I presume there are no further issues w/ Q16.

As I highlighted earlier, Its not accepting the answer if I follow correct
logic for renaming for example 209->210, but it is accepting if rename as
209->310

Here in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit,
that’s why 209 would be 310.

In attempting the third question, I’m unable to download the npm package as it
requires docker. When trying to install docker from the installer, it freezes
in the verifying package stage. Can somebody please help solve my problem?

numerical answer. A small red circle with a white "i" inside it appears in the

Hi Suhani,

npm does not require docker.

Kind regards

**carlton** on 2025-01-11T17:48:02.553Z:

Hi Hisham,

Its described in the question. There is a hidden element hiding somewhere
after that question. You would have to inspect the DOM to find it.

Hello Sir. I am unable to install uv in my windows system. Whenever I run the
code provided at the reference link in Powershell, my anti-virus system sends
a message that it was blocked. Even after blocking Real-time security, uv does
not display. What am I doing wrong?

Hi manmeet,

I don’t know about solution to this.  
Some network setting might be causing problem.

Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours
of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and
visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student
developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits
such as cloud resources and domains.

I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces
works very well if you have good internet connection.
