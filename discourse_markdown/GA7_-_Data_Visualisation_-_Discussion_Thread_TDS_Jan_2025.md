Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),  
I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns
include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series
ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could
someone please assist me with this?

Price Index (PPI) industry data for pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing.
Two sections are visible, one for "Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis
preparations" and another for "Calcium channel blockers." Both sections
include data such as Series Title, Series ID (e.g., PCU3254123254127111 and
PCU3254123254127114), Seasonality (indicated as 'Not Seasonally Adjusted'),
Survey Name ('PPI Industry Data'), Measure Data Type, Industry
('Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing') and Item, which mirrors the
Measure Data Type. The data is presented in a grid format with column headers
A through J. The overall color scheme is white background with dark gray grid
lines and black text."](https://europe1.discourse-

[![Here's alt text describing the image: A screenshot shows a question and
instructions for a data analysis task. The text is primarily black on a light
gray background, with dark teal headings. The question is titled "Question
7.1" and presents a scenario where a political party wants to analyze the
impact of Indian pharmaceutical exports to the US. A key figure is mentioned:
₹2,42,888 Crores (the value of exports). Provided files include "Industry
Product Segment Information" and "Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year
data)". The instructions detail creating a Google Sheet workbook with specific
naming conventions, sharing it with a particular email address, and creating
specific sheets and pivot tables with named columns and rows. The instructions
use numbered steps and include a note emphasizing the importance of exact
sheet naming.](https://europe1.discourse-

@[Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/Jivraj)

In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are  
![Here's alt text describing the image: "A close-up view of a line of text
that reads, '4. Sheet1: Columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and
Value.' The text is black on a white background and appears to be a

but the dataset provided has no column named “Item”  
![Here's alt text describing the image: A table with five columns displays
data. The column headers are "Series ID," "Year," "Period," "Label," and
"Value." The first row shows a "Series ID" of "PCU3254-3254-", "Year" of 2023,
"Period" of "M01", "Label" of "2023 Jan", and a "Value" of "562.445". A second
partially visible row begins with "PCU3254-3254-". The table has a dark gray
header row and white data rows. The numbers are in black
font.](https://europe1.discourse-

Item is there in other sheet we might have to join them to get items.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir I don’t have Microsoft PowerPoint. What should I do
?

Below items don’t have prices.

PCU3254123254127111 | Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations  
---|---  
PCU3254123254127114 | Calcium channel blockers  
PCU325412325412MM | Miscellaneous receipts  
PCU325412325412D112OC | Other digestive or genito-urinary preparations, over-the-counter  
PCU325412325412D113 | Antacids  
PCU325412325412SS | Secondary products  
PCU3254123254127112 | ACE inhibitors  
  
Some items don’t have prices for all 24 months.  
Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024
December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.

Shall I delete the records for which price is not available?  

[![A Google Sheet displaying a table of pharmaceutical data for the year 2023.
The sheet shows the sum of values for different pharmaceutical items,
categorized in the left column (e.g., ACE inhibitors, Analgesics,
Antidepressants). Each item's total value and monthly values (M01-M05) are
listed in columns. The data is primarily numerical, with values ranging from 0
to over 1000. The table headers are clearly labeled "Year," "Month," "Total,"
"2023," "M01," "M02," "M03," "M04," and "M05." Two rows, "ACE inhibitors" and
"Antacids," are highlighted with red arrows, indicating possible points of
interest or selection. The overall color scheme is typical of a Google Sheet,
with light gray and white backgrounds for cells.](https://europe1.discourse-

Hi Tanya,

Both you responses have been recorded. So it has not been deleted. Its just

Kind regards
