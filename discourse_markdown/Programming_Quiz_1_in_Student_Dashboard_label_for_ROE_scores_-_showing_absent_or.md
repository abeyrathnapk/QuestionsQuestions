Dear Sir,

I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the
ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.

I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing
this issue

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,

I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware
that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my
dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.”

I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a
backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly
look into this and confirm?

Thank you

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
I submitted my exam with perfect 10 score I even went to the technical meet
you guys kept and I asked that my score it showing 5/10 but I used the hacking
procedure can you please tell what is my score and he said that we will take
your highest score only and don’t worry it’s not 5, then I got a invite for
the meet you guys kept for those who scored perfectly in the roe, after all
this I don’t understand how is my score 60 percent.

24F1001631 here. It is also showing absent for me. I had submitted before the
time limit and also after the time limit after hacking it(wasn’t sure if it
was allowed but decided to try it nevertheless)

I feel I should atleast receive the marks for which I had submitted within the
time limit.

My roll number is 24F1001631.
