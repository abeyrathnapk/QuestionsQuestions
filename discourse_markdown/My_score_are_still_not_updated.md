my score from week 2 to week 5 are still showing not submitted.

[![Here's alt text describing the image: A screenshot shows a light gray
online interface displaying a student's progress in a course broken down by
modules. Each module, numbered 1 through 5, has a title (e.g., "Module 2:
Deployment Tools") and associated assignments listed below. Module 2 shows an
assignment called "Graded Assignment 2" with a status of "Not Submitted" and a
due date of February 2nd, 2025. For this module, there's also a table showing
the student's score, peer average, and median score, all currently indicated
by hyphens. The background is light gray, with the text mostly dark gray.
Small downward-pointing arrows indicate expandable
sections.](https://europe1.discourse-

[@23f1000879](/u/23f1000879) This is not the screen where you see your scores
for Tools in Data Science. Its only shown on dashboard. Can you send a
screenshot of your dashboard. Thanks

Kind regards
