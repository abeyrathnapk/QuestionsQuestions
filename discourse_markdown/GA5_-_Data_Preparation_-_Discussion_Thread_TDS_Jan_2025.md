[@23f1002630](/u/23f1002630) \- thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t
re-occur for anyone.

**What happened?** I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds,
but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length.
That’s what I fixed.

It was solved but again I’m facing the same issue

**nilaychugh** on 2025-02-11T16:21:34.546Z:

i guess there’s some issue in 5th question as i have correctly filtered the
data in OpenRefine 2-3 times but still getting incorrect in the portal.

**carlton** on 2025-02-12T12:52:01.867Z:

OpenRefine question has historically been a tricky question to get right.
Check out some past TA sessions in previous term for solving it, or previous
discourse posts.

Kind regards

## Cleaning Data with OpenRefine

Kindly check the question and the answer. I found below cities for São Paulo.

However, it says my answer is incorrect.

Wrong / Confusing question Prof

The top line mentions “Saturdays” whereas the bottom line mentions “Sundays”

Please clarify “SUNDAY” or “SATURDAY”?

[![Alt text: A document detailing a peak usage analysis for regional content
on the website s-anand.net. The analysis focuses on data from Apache web
server logs for May 2024, specifically targeting successful GET requests to
the "telugu" section on Saturdays between 13:00 and 23:00. The log file, a
61MB GZipped file with 258,074 rows, presents a challenge due to its non-
standard format: fields are space-separated, mostly double-quoted, with some
exceptions in quoting and 41 rows with unique quoting issues. The task is to
determine the number of successful GET requests within the specified
parameters to inform resource scaling, content planning, and marketing
strategies. The document details the log file's fields (IP, remote logname,
remote user, time, request, status, size, referer, user agent, vhost, server)

Update: I tried for both (thank god for filters in Excel) and Sunday is what
the question is asking for. The Instruction above for “Saturday” is incorrect-
maybe the logic generating different questions for different students can be
tweaked-

Thank you

I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the
answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this
question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here,
however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public
forum.

Please consider my request and double check-

Thank you
