Would we be able to start work on the questions 1 hour before the exam start
time?



---
**carlton** on 2025-03-01T09:01:56.407Z:

[@bhashwar_sengupta](/u/bhashwar_sengupta) No that will not be possible. It
will go live only at 1 pm.

**bhashwar_sengupta** on 2025-03-01T09:40:09.245Z:

Got it. Thank you. Also, are there any standard set of instructions that we
need to follow during the ROE, like in OPPEs?

**Yogesh1** on 2025-03-01T11:19:35.700Z:

Is it 45 minutes long?



---
**23f2004837** on 2025-03-01T15:16:32.904Z:

No, it is 45 minutes ‘short’

**23f2004636** on 2025-03-01T16:34:53.754Z:

[@carlton](/u/carlton) will exam take place on the IITM Exam Portal (like
other JAVA, Python OPPE) or will it take place on the TDS course portal like
we had for Weekly GA?

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir, I could only find one live session of ROE in
youtube. Can you please point out where are the other recordings?



---
**carlton** on 2025-03-02T02:43:00.880Z:

All week 7 sessions are ROE mock solving questions. Only the 4th session was a
special session and was labelled as such, but it also has a mock solving
component. These are all available on the Youtube channel

[@carlton](/u/carlton)

I hope the Remote Online Exam (ROE) is ready to be uploaded to the portal. Is
there any update regarding the additional time request? Can we expect any
consideration on this?
