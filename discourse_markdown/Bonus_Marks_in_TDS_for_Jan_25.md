Greetings sir!  
Sir, I have a query about the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS
course. I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus
marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it
improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6
assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?  
As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would
be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?

Thank you and Regards  
Akshit

Yes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses.  
However, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4
seems quite different.  
Is this information available to everyone [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir?

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)
[@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,  
I hope you are doing well.

As per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the
7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention
of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5
bonus marks for GA7. Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2,
some of us were unable to complete GA7.

Now, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email
stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute
to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade. Since
this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to
consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these
bonus marks—perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of
assessment.

We sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful
if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well.

Looking forward to your kind consideration.

Best regards,  
Digvijaysinh Chudasama

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) same happens for me also sir plz
look into this matter.

**[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)**  
There seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the GA marking scheme,
which feels quite arbitrary. Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15%
weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full
marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5
and GA6, which you can verify.

Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7.
If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be
communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as
students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance.

I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should
be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if
GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to
attempt or review it accordingly.

**[@carlton](/u/carlton)** , we request you to kindly consider this matter. We
are looking forward to a quick response — hopefully one that ensures fairness
for all students.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir ,

This would be a deviation from the grading format right sir? As some of us
were proactive and closed the 4 GA requirement earlier, if such extra
weightage is given to a certain GA unannounced then how is it fair on the
other students ?  
Kindly consider

**23f2004837** on 2025-04-09T13:26:12.842Z:

same for me also …  
Please consider all the GA for the calculation and give bonus based on the
overall performance in GA’s instead of one GA.

**mahi.13** on 2025-04-09T13:26:16.747Z:

Exactly! This should have been informed beforehand.  
It’s really unfair



---
**23f2004793** on 2025-04-09T13:26:37.649Z:

It the team wants to give bonus marks then why specifically to peer review
week-7 ? Like all the GAs were equally important ! So please do something
about this.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)  
I have completed 5 GAs, but missed others due to the time commitment required,
along with managing three other subjects and one project. I kindly request
that 5 bonus marks be awarded to all, as the additional marks for GA were not
communicated earlier. This could result in a disadvantage for those of us who
were unaware of the extra marks for GA7. Thank you for considering this.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) I genuinely wish I could respond more humbly, but the
way this has unfolded makes it hard — and sadly, I’m not MSD to handle it all
with silence and a smile.

Good evening [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)
[@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir,  
I hope you are well

According to the grading document, we were told that only the best 4 out of
the 7 assessments would count towards our final grade. There was no mention of
any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7
before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2,
some of us couldn’t complete GA7.

Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they’ve
been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score
and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn’t shared
earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for
those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a
submission review or another form of assessment.

We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you
could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too.

Best regards,  
Palaash V. Upadhyay

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
Yes sir , we have completed all the previous ga but not able to do week 7 , we
feel that the bonus should be given to all on the basis of ga and not only on
week 7 . Or it should have been informed earlier if such bonus was to be given
. Please do consider our request . Thank you

**23f1000598** on 2025-04-09T14:23:26.329Z:

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)
[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

The sudden introduction of bonus marks for GA7 in Tools in Data Science has
left many students confused, as there was no prior intimation regarding this
change. We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated
“best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about
transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic
assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a
fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course
coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated
on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and
academic integrity.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)  
Yes Sir, I also completed 6 GAs even tho it was written only best 4 out of 7
GAs would be considered for final grade, but couldn’t complete GA 7 due to
pressure of other subjects, if it was written in the grading document I would
have done it, hoping you would understand Sir, Please do consider our request.  
Thank you

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir in the grading document it was mentioned best 4 out
of 7 assignments but I did 6 GAs but skipped GA7 due to other assignments and
projects but now we got to know that 5 bonus marks are given in ga 7 which
seems unfair to all of us as mostly people who did GA7 are the one who were
not able to complete previous GAs so giving bonus for the last day give them a
edge

If it was announced before deadline of GA 7 it was okay and good for us to
improve our grade but now it seems quite unfair so, please come with the best
possible solution for this

Thanking you

waiting for your answer
