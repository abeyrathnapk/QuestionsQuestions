Dear all,

I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the *Tools in
Data Science * course: [**LLM Classroom Assignment
Evaluator**](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom).
This is the basic prototype.

This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for
Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for
educators.

A heartfelt thanks to **[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)** , our course instructor, and
TAs **[@Carlton](/u/carlton)** and **[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)** , whose guidance
on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project
possible.

I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:

  * Expand functionality and evaluation models.
  * Fix bugs and optimize workflows.
  * Improve documentation for broader accessibility.

The [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom)
is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating
with you all!

Update: here is a video explaining the process -

Best regards,

Hi Avinash,

Thats great work! I am glad you were able to use what you learnt from the
course for something so practical. I hope you continue to develop and refine
it, take feedback from the stakeholders who would be interested in this
approach. I see a lot of potential in this project.

Kind regards

Thanks [@carlton](/u/carlton) ![Here's alt text describing the image: "A
large, bright yellow emoji with rosy cheeks smiles broadly. The smile is a
wide, upward curve, and the eyes are closed in happiness. The emoji is
slightly rounded, not perfectly circular, and is set against a slightly darker
orange background that is only visible at the
edges."](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/blush.png?v=12) I would
definitely refine it.
