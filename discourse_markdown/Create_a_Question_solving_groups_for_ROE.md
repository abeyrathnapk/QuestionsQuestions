Whoever wants can participate and then we go into breakout rooms and each
group solves a particular question and then we all share the code so we can
complete the ROE faster and more effienctly?

Are we allowed to do that?

Yeah they said you can take help anyway possible even to ask a cat also or a
pet, im not sure

Alright, works. I am down to collaborate.

Asking help is different from sharing answers in a public forum. I don’t think
they will permit this.

Sharing answers is asking for help

If the ROE is like how it was for MOCK ROE1 then this probably wont work
right?  
Only for today’s ROE(mock 2) we can split the tasks efficiently and get it
done.  
Thoughts?

features a large, uppercase white letter 'T' in a simple, sans-serif font. The
'T' is centered. There's a subtle, light-colored speckled texture faintly
visible behind the 'T', adding a slightly grainy effect. The overall
impression is clean and minimalist."](https://dub1.discourse-

with short, slightly graying brown hair. He's wearing glasses and a dark-
colored shirt. The lighting is dramatic, with a warm, reddish-brown background
that contrasts with the lighter tones on his face. The man's expression is
somewhat serious and pensive. There is no visible text in the

Their whole concept of implicit learning disappears when people start sharing
answers in a public forum.
