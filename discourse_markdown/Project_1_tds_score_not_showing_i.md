Project results have not been released yet. They have posponed everything.  
Please look into this post.

cheekbones and nose. His expression is somewhat serious and contemplative.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),  
My Project 1 scores are not visible on the part, I have definitely submitted
before the deadline and on the grades section - its coming as not submitted. I
have mailed support team as well. Will it be possible to check the same in any
manner.

Regards,  
Ajit

No one has received their Project 1 scores yet. We are hoping to very soon
announce preliminary results. (maybe in 24 hours or so). Depends how many bugs
we get bitten by.

Kind regards

You failed pre requisites check. Hence there is no evaluation email.  
i.e. the score is 0 which will be pushed to dashboard on after 1/4/25

Only those that passed the pre requisite check got emails with scores.

**HARISH.S** on 2025-03-30T03:54:28.227Z:

Sir can you check and say if I passed or not. The link that I submitted for
project 1 in the gform contains two links. I wrote ‘and’ between two website
link.

**carlton** on 2025-04-04T09:08:56.128Z:

No issue with your submission, you will get a good score.

Kind regards



---
**carlton** on 2025-04-04T09:10:28.633Z:

Hi you were supposed to provide just one github link in the format specified.
You failed to do that and therefore your submission was not evaluated.

Kind regards
