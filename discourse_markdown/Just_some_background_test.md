[![Here's alt text describing the image: A high-angle, full shot of a grey and
white Scottish Fold cat sitting on a light brown wood floor. The cat is
upright, with its paws pressed together as if in prayer or supplication. Its
large, round eyes are expressive. The cat's fur is predominantly white on its
chest and belly, with grey tabby markings on its back and legs. The background
is a simple, light brown wood floor with visible wood grain. No other objects
or text are present.](https://europe1.discourse-
