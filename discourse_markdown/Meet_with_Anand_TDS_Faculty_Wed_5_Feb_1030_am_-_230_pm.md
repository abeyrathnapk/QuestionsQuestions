I will be at the IIT Madras campus next Wednesday (5 Feb) from 10:30 am to
2:30 pm IST.

I’ll be at the NAC (New Academic Complex) or the NAC footsteps.

If anyone would like to chat - about TDS, or anything else - you’re welcome.

[![Here's alt text describing the image: A profile of Anand S., CEO of
Gramener, is shown. The text is primarily black on a white background. The
header reads "Anand S." in a bold, large font, followed by "CEO, Gramener" in
a smaller font. A dark maroon underlined tab labeled "Profile" sits below. The
profile text describes Anand as a co-founder of the data science company
Gramener, listing his achievements including being recognized as one of
India's top 10 scientists, a regular TEDx speaker, and his educational
background and professional experience at institutions such as IIM Bangalore,
IIT Madras, and several prominent companies. It also notes his personal
interests including hand-transcribing every Calvin & Hobbes comic strip,
playing Minecraft, and his goal to watch every film on the IMDb Top 250
(excluding *The Shining*). Finally, it includes links to his blog
(s-anand.net) and his talks (bit.ly/anandtalks).](https://europe1.discourse-

Thank you for taking out time to meet today. It was great to meet you Sir, and
was a great pleasant surprise to meet our wonderful TAs,
[@carlton](/u/carlton) and [@jivraj](/u/jivraj) (and, TAs for Java and
Statistics I too. sorry, I am unable to tag them with names) as well. I am
inspired to continue learning deeper and more… such interactions are very
helpful. Thank you.
