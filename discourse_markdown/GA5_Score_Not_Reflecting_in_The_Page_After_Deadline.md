[![Here's alt text describing the image: A screenshot shows a dark-themed
online quiz interface titled "TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data Preparation". The main
body text is white on a dark gray background. Instructions are listed
numerically, explaining that participants can check answers frequently, save
progress, reload the page, use any resources, and even attempt to hack the
code to find answers. A button prompts users to join a discussion on
Discourse. Below the instructions is a section showing "Recent saves" with
three entries indicating the time and score of past submissions. The user is
logged in as "2313004238@ds.study.litm.ac.in." The top of the screen displays
a browser window with the quiz URL and the user's score as 0. A red banner at
the top alerts the user that a new Chrome update is available. The overall
color scheme is dark, with accents of red and teal in the buttons and
banners.](https://europe1.discourse-

Is this something to worry about?

This is nothing to worry about because as you can see in the Recent saves
section, it has your score history. We have your entire submission history
because we log that.

Kind regards
