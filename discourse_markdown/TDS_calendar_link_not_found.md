Hi Sahil,

Please find it at the following location.

[![Here's alt text describing the image: A dark-themed webpage displays course
information for a "Tools in Data Science" course. On the left, a navigation
menu lists categories like "Development Tools," "Large Language Models," "Data
Sourcing," and "Data Visualization." The main content area on the right shows
details about teaching assistants, including contact information for Jivraj
Singh and instructions for a virtual GPT assistant. Under "Course Links,"
links to a discussion forum, student handbook, and the course homepage are
listed. Further down, "Jan 2025 Links" lists several items including grading
documents, course calendar, announcements, course materials, and TA session
YouTube playlists. All text is in white or light gray against the dark
background.](https://europe1.discourse-
