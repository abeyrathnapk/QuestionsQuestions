I submitted the form before the deadline with the API endpoint as /api, but I
later realized the correct format was /api/ (with a trailing slash). To fix
this, I edited the Google Form today.

Will this cause any issues with the submission? Please let me know if any
further action is needed.

It is not like that, it can be any endpoint, but whatever you submit should
work. Like many frameworks treat /api/ and /api differently.

The project 2 docs assumes that the endpoint is /api/ and provides the code
accordingly.

you are right but if I use postman with /api end point it wont work but with
/api/ it will work so..
