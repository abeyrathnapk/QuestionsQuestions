[ ![Here's alt text describing the image: An illustration announces "WEEK 4
SESSION 4" in large, bold, white sans-serif font against a dark blue
rectangular banner. This banner is centered on an off-white background, which
in turn is framed by a peach-colored border. The off-white area is densely
filled with small, colorful illustrations representing various data points,
charts, graphs, and technology icons. These include bar graphs, pie charts,
network diagrams, pencils, a smartphone, and a global icon, all in a vibrant,
mid-century modern style using blues, yellows, oranges, reds, and blacks. The
overall style is abstract and playful, suggesting data analysis or a progress
report.](https://europe1.discourse-
