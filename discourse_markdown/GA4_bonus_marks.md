Sir,  
I haven’t received bonus marks in ga4 as, i posted queries in discourse
regarding ga4. I have scored 8 marks in ga4, but after bonus marks it should
be 9, but in dashboard it is showing only 80 marks.  
Kindly, update my marks in dashboard.

Hi [@Sakshi6479](/u/sakshi6479),

You have not followed the instruction in GA4 for the bonus mark.

[![Here's alt text for the image: A light teal-colored rectangle contains text
announcing a bonus mark opportunity. The main text states, "Bonus marks for
posting on Discourse". Smaller text explains that IITM BS students who reply
to a discussion thread titled "GA4-Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan
2025]" with a relevant question or reply will receive one bonus mark on a
graded assignment. All text is in dark gray or
black.](https://europe1.discourse-

We were given the list by Anand for all those that followed this instruction.

That is why you have not received the bonus mark for GA4.

Kind regards
