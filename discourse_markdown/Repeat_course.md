Even if I pass in end term TDS, Can I repeat the course in next term because I
missed project1 and my CGPA will go down because of it?

This is my last term of diploma. So, can I take 1 diploma course and rest
degree courses in next term?

TDS is the worst subject to repeat in order to improve CGPA.

Its better to take a high credit, easy course to improve CGPA. **We never
recommend taking TDS for grade improvement.** If you have passed it, its
better to move on.
