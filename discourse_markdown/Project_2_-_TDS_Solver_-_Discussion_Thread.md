is it possible to have written solutions to all 5 assignments , instead of
just live sessions. I have certain pending questions from the first 5
assignements.



---
**22f3002291** on 2025-03-03T05:12:53.749Z:

Please quickly arrange a live TDS session to explain this project. There are a
lot of doubts and questions in our minds.



---
**22f3002291** on 2025-03-03T05:33:25.883Z:

Please also give access to the answers for GAs. So that we can evaluate our
api with the correct answers.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir, is there any bonus marks for code uniqueness and
extra tasks like project 1



---
**23f3001743** on 2025-03-03T06:20:33.077Z:

If we use ngrok to create a tunnel to our API or Llamafile server, for how
long should our terminal remain running? Should it be active only at the time
of submission, or must it be continuously available until evaluation is
completed?



---
**23f2000573** on 2025-03-03T06:40:11.842Z:

Is it like only the questions from the portal will be sent to the api?

If yes, is this project just about finding which question is asked and
accordingly match the answer send the answer as response?

Hello Sir,

I understand that we can deploy on vercel. Can it be deployed on Heroku as
well? I believe both serve the same purpose. Wanted to know your thoughts on
the same sir.

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your
results



---
**Jivraj** on 2025-03-03T07:34:57.718Z:

Any question from first 5 Ga‚Äôs can be there and you would need to analyze
which question it is, you can use function calling or prompting as well.
Function calling is better approach here.

Hi [@24f2006531](/u/24f2006531)

You can deploy it anywhere, just test how it works on Heroku, if it works(send
request to api endpoint to your application and it should respond with answer)

Kind regards

**22f3001315** on 2025-03-03T08:38:46.572Z:

will the asked question be same which was asked in my GAs (i mean there were
variations in problem statements for diff-diff students.)  
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir



---
**Yogesh1** on 2025-03-03T08:59:32.067Z:

Was the variation because of the datasets? Or even the problem statement?



---
**22f3001315** on 2025-03-03T09:25:06.689Z:

Mostly problem statement like different cities etc



---
**Yogesh1** on 2025-03-03T09:29:47.534Z:

Then it comes down to what the project demands, as in what kind of questions
the llm will be tested on (like you said). Hope the team can give us a test
set like in the first project.



---
**nilaychugh** on 2025-03-03T09:42:02.201Z:

my question is some graded assignments have image files as a answer, so should
our api return files as the answer or like can you clarify what type of
answers we need to work on?



---
**23f2000237** on 2025-03-03T10:04:24.668Z:

I guess yes, our APIs should return photos if required



---
**Jivraj** on 2025-03-03T11:42:29.654Z:

@all

Keep posting your doubts here we will have answers to all of your doubts In
