**“Students are allowed to take help from their pets in completing
assignments.”**  
So I did. ![Here's alt text for the image: "A simplified, blocky cartoon
illustration of a person with short brown hair, a yellow face, and a teal
shirt. The person is smiling and has their right arm extended out to the side,
as if gesturing or pointing. The style is reminiscent of emojis or pixel art.
The background is transparent."](https://emoji.discourse-

### ![Here's alt text describing the image: "A cartoon illustration of a dog's
head. The dog is predominantly light beige or cream-colored, with brown floppy
ears and a brown patch over its right eye. It has dark eyes, a small black
nose, and a pink tongue sticking out. The style is simple and pixelated,
resembling an emoji or simple icon."](https://emoji.discourse-

dark gray graduation cap, viewed from a slightly elevated angle, with a gold-
colored tassel hanging down the left side. The cap is square-shaped and the
tassel is a simple, slightly frayed design. The background is transparent
black."](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/graduation_cap.png?v=14)
_Confession: My Labrador Did All My Assignments_ ![Here's alt text describing
the image: "A stack of three books, slightly askew, viewed from a slightly
elevated angle. The top book is red, the middle book is dark gray or black,
and the bottom book is blue. A thin sliver of light green is visible between
the top and middle books. The spines of the books are visible, and they all
appear to have dark colored banding or markings along the top and bottom of
the spine. The overall style is simplistic and
cartoonish."](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/books.png?v=14)![Here's
alt text for the image: "A light teal or pale blue laptop computer is shown
from a front-on perspective. The screen is dark gray/teal and blank, and the
keyboard is a slightly lighter shade of the laptop's casing. No text is
visible on the screen or the laptop itself."](https://emoji.discourse-

Yes, I got **great marks** in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1.  
But let’s be real…

It was **my Labrador** who did the actual work ![Here's alt text describing
the image: "A cartoon illustration of a German Shepherd dog wearing a red and
black service dog harness. A bright blue light bar is attached to the harness.
The dog is light brown and tan, viewed from the side in a standing position
against a black background. The style is simple and slightly
pixelated."](https://emoji.discourse-
cdn.com/google/service_dog.png?v=14)![Here's alt text describing the image: "A
simplified, cartoonish illustration of a human brain. The brain is rendered in
shades of pale pink and deeper reddish-pink, with the folds and convolutions
of the brain exaggerated for visual effect. The style is reminiscent of a
pixelated or low-resolution image. The brain is presented against a solid
black background."](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/brain.png?v=14)

While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:

  * Solving **deployment issues** faster than my dev server boots
  * Writing **function calling code** like a true GPT whisperer
  * Fixing **LLM bugs** that I didn’t even understand

Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket.  
He growled at broken APIs.  
I took the credit. ![Here's alt text describing the image: "A simple,
pixelated illustration shows a hand with three fingers, painted a bright
reddish-orange, having nail polish applied. The nail polish bottle is a dark
gray, and the brush is applying the polish to the middle fingernail. The hand
is a yellowish-orange color. The background is
black."](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/nail_polish.png?v=14)

### ![Here's alt text describing the image: "A cartoon megaphone angled toward
the lower right. The megaphone is primarily white with a red handle and a dark
teal/blue speaker cone. The style is simple and slightly
pixelated."](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/loudspeaker.png?v=14)

### ![Here's alt text describing the image: "Two bright blue paw prints on a
black background. The paw prints are simple, slightly pixelated shapes,
suggesting a digital or stylized representation rather than a photograph. No
text is present."](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/paw_prints.png?v=14)
Moral of the story:

Let your pets help with your coursework.  
You get the grade. They get the rage.

After fighting so much for GA, ROE, Project 1, and Project 2, my inner animal
got hurt and fell asleep — and that’s how I ended up missing GA7. Please don’t
hurt him any further.
