*Here's alt text for the image:

A laptop displays an open book on its screen, the pages showing "DSA" (Data Structures and Algorithms) prominently.  The laptop is centrally positioned against a light-blue background filled with various data structures and algorithms diagrams, charts, and code snippets, all rendered in shades of light grey and white. The diagrams include nodes connected by lines, flowcharts, and graphs, visually representing computer science concepts.  The text "PROGRAMMING," "DATA STRUCTURES," and "AND ALGORITHMS" appears multiple times throughout the background, reinforcing the image's theme. The overall style is clean and modern, suggesting a conceptual illustration of learning or working with data structures and algorithms.*
